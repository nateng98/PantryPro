# Coding Style

## Naming
All classes will capitalize the first letter of each word, no spaces
```java
ExampleClassName
```

All variables and methods will be camel case
```java
exampleName
```

All constants will be uppercase separated by underscores
```java
EXAMPLE_NAME
```

## Format
All open curly braces `{` will be on the same line as the construct<br>
All closed curly braces `}` will be vertically in line with its construct<br>
Curly braces will be used explicitly for all statements (ifs, loops, etc.)<br>
All indents will be 4 spaces (done with a tab button)
```java
if(boolVal) {
    //Do something
}
```

All classes will be formatted as follows:
```java
class ClassName {
    //Variables

    //Constructors

    //Methods
}
```

## Commenting
Commenting will be kept to a minimum, only commenting when the intent is unclear or further notation may be helpful
