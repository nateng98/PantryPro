# Pantry Pro Vision Statement

### Overview
Pantry Pro is an app to create, save, and share recipes that track calories as well as using these recipes to plan meals for the coming days.

### Our Project
<!-- Old
We want our Recipe App to be a place where users can track meal nutritional intake, save their favorite recipes and share those recipes with friends!
-->

<!-- Less Old
Our Recipe App is a place where you can explore new dishes while also keeping your personal recipes in a safe place. We want to create an experience that's all about making life in the kitchen easier for you. This app will be for anyone looking to simplify their meal tracking, recipe organization, and food exploration.
-->

Pantry Pro is a place where people can create, save, and share their own recipes, as well as see and save recipes from other people across the app. When creating recipes, Pantry Pro will allow users to add ingredients, steps, and pictures to illustrate when necessary. These recipes will calculate and display the calorie value based on the amount of each ingredient required to make the dish. On top of simply saving recipes from other people, users will be able to edit and personalize these recipes so that they can make adjustments or substitutions that they prefer. Additionally, Pantry Pro will have a calendar where users can plan their meals for the week ahead of time, helping them to be more organized and time efficient. Adding a recipe to a meal for a day will also add the ingredients to a checklist so that people can check off items they already have and have a concise list to follow for their next shopping trip.

### Our Users
<!-- Old
Losing your old recipes pages all the time? Tired of manually calculating your calories for a meal? Found a high-protein recipe you think your friends will like? Look no further than the nutrition app! This app is for anyone wanting to live a healthier lifestyle or anyone who just wants a place to be able to save/find their beloved recipes.
-->

<!-- Less Old
A user of our app is anyone looking to stay more organized in the kitchen, looking to explore new dishes, keep their important recipes safe, or maybe track their eating in an easier way. For whatever the reason, we think just about anyone could benefit from this app.
-->

Pantry Pro is designed for really anyone who cooks or wants to cook. It is a place to save recipes and plan meals so whether it's a professional cook wanting to try out new things and be able to easily edit the recipe on the go or someone just trying to learn how to cook while staying organized in the kitchen, this app offers something of worth.


### Values
<!-- Old
This project brings value to its users by giving them a place where they can keep their recipes safe while tracking they're intakes, giving people a 'one-stop-shop' for all their dietary needs.
-->

<!-- Less Old
We think this app can bring value to people for many reasons. It can give the users a space where they can keep their age-old recipes safe without running out of pages, find new recipes to try, share their recipes with friends, and even track the nutritional intake of each recipe.
-->

Pantry Pro has so much to offer over physical recipes and other apps. It offers a space where you can easily find new recipes and search for recipes that you've always wanted to try. Writing out a physical recipe takes a long time and, when you're trying new things, editing a physical paper is annoying and awkward. With Pantry Pro, it's easy to edit and change things in the moment and you can add pictures to make it easier to follow in the future. Next, Pantry Pro offers an easy space to keep all the recipes you love; having them all in one place and being able to group them into categories makes it easier to navigate and view. Pantry Pro also offers meal planning, which easily beats doing it by hand - having to either use more paper each week, erasing everything to write plans for the next week, or having some other inconvenient method that just "gets the job done". On top of all this, Pantry Pro makes it easy to track your calorie intake, calculating the calories based on the ingredients in each recipe.


### Criteria
<!-- should we make this into a paragraph or leave it how it is? -->

We would consider this project a success if our users are able to:

- Log in and get a familiar feel of the app. This would demonstrate that the platform is useable for people of all ages and abilities
- Create their own recipes and be able to follow recipe's created by others. Adding ingredients and steps to follow to create a dish is the main goal of any good recipe.
- Share those recipes with other users/friends. 
  - Post recipes in a place where others can see
- Save recipes others have posted. It's always a terrible feeling when you can't find that recipe you tried once and really liked. This would avoid this issue altogether!
- Track the calories of a recipes. Calculating the calories of a dish based on the amount of each specified ingredient would let our users be concious about what they are eating and let them avoid manually calculating their intake.

To measure this we will implement a survey to be answered by users who have used the app by a significant amount of time. The survey will evaluate the level of satisfaction perceived by the users at the aforementioned points. 
We aim to have 90% of users reporting high satisfaction across the different points.
